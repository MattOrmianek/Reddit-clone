# Frontend

This directory contains a minimal React setup using webpack.

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

This will install React along with the webpack tooling defined in
`package.json` (webpack, webpack-dev-server, Babel, etc.). The `npm start`
command relies on these local packages, so running `npm install` is required
before starting the server.

2. Start the development server:

```bash
npm start
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:8080` by default.
